This tree is to hold MY versions of the programs, notes, etc. from "Programming Rust"

In most cases the definition of "my version" is that I have added extensive comments to the
programs, as I worked through the book and learned the rust language.

These programs are made avaialbe AS IS, with no gurantee that they will do ANYTHING, such as
compile, link, run, destroy, or not destroy your system.

If you want/need something different I stgrongly suggest you buy the book:
 Programming Rust", 2nd edition, by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F.S. Tindall
 Copyright  2021 Jim Blandy, Leonora F.S. Tindall, Jason Orendorff.  All rights reservd.
 Published by O'Reilly Media Inc. 
and work through the examples yourself. 

These programs were developed on MacBook Pro running macOS Big Sur (Version 11.6.x)
using version 1.53.0 of the rust compiler and tools.
 
Installed cargo-edit 0.7.0 to make it easy to add/update crates in my environment.
This gives you "cargo add", "cargo rm", and "cargo upgrade" capabilities and the
ability to modify your Cargo.toml file from the command line.
